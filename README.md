## How to use files in EmployeeSQL:

* First, run schema.sql
* Then, populate the tables in order of creation by importing csv files in data folder to respected tables.
* Next, run query.sql to query data in the tables.
* Lastly, run Bonus_Analysis.ipynb to veiw SQLAlchemy queries and data visualizations.
  * NOTE: Bonus_Analysis.ipynb pulls in a config.py file with the variables user_password and db_name that is NOT included in the EmployeeSQL folder.
